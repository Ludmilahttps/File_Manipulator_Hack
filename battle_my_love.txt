I know what you said
And I've been torn apart since the day you left
I don't think I can do it again
So much in my own head
Totally obsessed with the shit you said
And I don't think I can do it again

Battle, my love
I will see you in the end
Carry my heart with you always
Battle, my love
I will see you in the end
Carry my heart with you

How much should I take
When everything you made you will someday break
And I don't think I can build it again
Too much in my own head

And I've been torn apart since the day you left
And I don't think I can do it again

Battle, my love
I will see you in the end
Carry my heart with you always

I know what you meant
And I've been torn apart since the day you left
I don't think I can do it again
Too much in my own head
Totally obsessed with the shit you said
And I don't think I can do it again do it again.
