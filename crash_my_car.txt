Walk in like a wrecking ball
The way she moves makes me miserable
All eyes on the golden girl
She's gonna tell ya, gonna tell ya, gonna tell ya
That you're too sweet
Swan dive to the concrete floor
The pavement never felt so warm
One look and you already know
She's gonna cut ya, gonna cut ya, gonna cut ya
Cut ya real deep

Baby, I'm freaking out
Lay it on me
Anything you want

You can crash my car tonight
Go out wasting all my time and money
I love the way you're breaking my heart
I can't stand to see you leaving lonely

I'll drive you home at the end of the night
I'll drive you home at the end of the night

Dead last as a drama queen
But I found myself in the front seat of her car
She's bad blood royalty and that's fine
Yeah, that's alright with me

Baby, I'm freaking out
Lay it on me
Light me up and lay me down
And love me like you shouldn't now

You can crash my car tonight
Go out wasting all my time and money
I love the way you're breaking my heart
And I can't stand to see you leaving lonely

I'll drive you home at the end of the night
I'll drive you home at the end of the night

Crash my car tonight
Go out, waste all of my time and money
I love the way you're breaking my heart
I can't stand to see you leaving lonely

Crash my car
Take all my money and run
Baby if that's what you want
Lonely, lonely

Crash my car
Take all my money and run
Baby if that's what you want
Lonely, lonely
