Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love
Than if you were alone

Memories turn into daydreams
Become a taboo

I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts, electric souls

Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know

That's all that really matters
I was a fool

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

Those thoughts of past lovers
They'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe
You'd never wrong me

Then will you remember me in the same way
As I remember you?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it till you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place in your house of memories

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh (in your house of memories)
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh (promise me a place)
